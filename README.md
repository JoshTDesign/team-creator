## Features  

*** 

Team Creator is designed to allow for each team to have one manager, and an unlimited number of engineers and interns. The simple html page that gets created is colorful and minimalist. Each job title is personalized with a unique color and icon, along with contact info fields specific to that job. The html file is also adaptable to any screen size and will expand to an unlimited number of team members.

### Challenges encountered  
This project represents my introduction to using subclass to create multiple related objects. It was a fun challenge to take those objects and manipulate them into a completely dynamic html file. This was also my first attempt at creating a Jest testing suite to assist in the programming process.

### How to install  
To install Team Creator, simply go to my repo, clone the repo link to your local machine. Make sure in use the `npm intall` command to install the dependencies before you try to run. Then enjoy!

### Where credit is due  
Team Creator relies on the fantastic Inquirer tool for command-line queries.
